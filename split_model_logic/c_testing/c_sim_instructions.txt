TO RUN:
1.Open two terminals, one for main and the other for Sub

2a. On a terminal, first run :
./c_main.exe

2b. On the other terminal, run the following:
./c_sub.exe

NOTE: this results in rewriting a text file, final_w_b.txt

3. Open Csim_xor_validation.py and run script. This will read the bias/weights from
the text file and determine accuracy for XOR problem

---------------------------
TO EDIT:
1. If on windows, please ensure you have mingw-w64 downloaded 
to run C++ files on VScode
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

2. If making edits to code, run
g++  c_sim_main.cpp act_pe.cpp array.cpp bias_pe.cpp error_pe.cpp weight_pe.cpp -o c_main -lws2_32
g++  c_sim_sub.cpp act_pe.cpp array.cpp bias_pe.cpp error_pe.cpp weight_pe.cpp -o c_sub  -lws2_32

3. Open two terminals, one for main and the other for Sub

4. On a terminal, first run :
./c_main

On the other terminal, run the following:
./c_client

NOTE: this results in rewriting a text file, learned_weights_bias.txt

5. Open Csim_xor_validation.py and run script. This will read the bias/weights from
the text file and determine accuracy for XOR problem
